## Description
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the changes you made to improve type safety. -->

## Type Safety Checklist
- [ ] No `any` types used unless explicitly justified with comments
- [ ] All explicit `any` types are replaced with proper types or interfaces
- [ ] Event handlers are properly typed with specific React event types
- [ ] Component props use appropriate interfaces with required/optional properly marked
- [ ] Props interfaces include JSDoc comments explaining each prop
- [ ] Theme/variants properly typed with discriminated unions when appropriate
- [ ] React hook dependencies properly typed and exhaustive
- [ ] CSS variable typing properly implemented with fallback values
- [ ] Consistent with FitCopilot token hierarchy
- [ ] Safe type assertions used (as const, satisfies, etc.)

## Design System Compliance

- [ ] Follows feature-first architecture
- [ ] Uses createVariantComponent for variants if needed

- [ ] Properly types WordPress API responses
- [ ] Works with theme customizer settings

## Testing
- [ ] Updated or added tests for component type safety
- [ ] Verified proper type checking in IDE
