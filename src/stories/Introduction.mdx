# FitCopilot Component Library

Welcome to the FitCopilot component library. This Storybook serves as an interactive documentation for all UI components used in the FitCopilot platform.

## Architecture

FitCopilot follows a feature-first approach to component organization:

- **UI Components**: Reusable, presentational elements without business logic
- **Layout Components**: Provide structure without business logic
- **Feature Components**: Self-contained application functionality

## Navigation

The sidebar is organized to match our component hierarchy:

- **Foundations**: Design tokens, colors, typography, and spacing
- **UI**: Basic UI components like buttons, inputs, and cards
- **Layout**: Structural components like containers, grids, and sections
- **Features**: Complex feature components organized by section (Homepage, Workouts, etc.)

## Component Structure

Each component story demonstrates:

- Default state and variations
- Interactive props through Controls
- Accessibility compliance
- Responsive behavior through Viewports
- Design specifications through Figma embeds (where available)

## Contributing

To add or update component stories, follow these guidelines:

1. Place story files next to the component they document
2. Include comprehensive prop documentation
3. Showcase all relevant states and variations
4. Ensure component passes all accessibility checks

For detailed guidelines, see the [Storybook Contribution Guide](https://docs.fitcopilot.com/contributing/storybook).
