# Cross-Feature Dependencies Analysis

This document analyzes the current dependencies between features and global utilities to help plan for Phase 2 of our architecture refactoring.

## Homepage Feature Dependencies

### External Dependencies

The Homepage feature currently has dependencies on several global resources:

1. **Global Styles**
   - `../../styles/homepage.scss` imported in `Homepage.tsx`
   - These should be internalized or properly abstracted

2. **Global Hooks**
   - `../../hooks/useAnimation` imported in `Homepage.tsx`
   - Should be moved to feature-specific hooks or properly shared

3. **Global Components**
   - `../../components/DemoNav` imported in `Homepage.tsx`
   - Consider if this should be feature-specific or shared

4. **Global Utilities**
   - `../../../utils/variantLoader` imported in `Hero/index.ts`
   - This is a legitimate shared utility but needs proper interface

### Internal Feature Structure

The Homepage feature has a well-organized internal structure:

- Main component: `Homepage.tsx`
- Section components: `Hero`, `Features`, `Journey`, etc.
- Feature-specific hooks: `useHomepageData`

## Dependency Types

We can categorize dependencies into:

1. **Style Dependencies**
   - Global styles that should be internalized
   - Shared design tokens that should be extracted

2. **Data Dependencies**
   - WordPress data access
   - API client utilities

3. **Component Dependencies**
   - UI components used across features
   - Layout components

4. **Utility Dependencies**
   - Pure functions with no side effects
   - Configuration utilities

## Phase 2 Planning

For each dependency type, we need to:

1. **Style Dependencies**
   - Create feature-specific style files
   - Extract shared design tokens to a global theme
   - Implement proper CSS scoping

2. **Data Dependencies**
   - Create a proper data access layer
   - Implement service interfaces for WordPress data
   - Use dependency injection patterns

3. **Component Dependencies**
   - Establish a shared component library
   - Document component interfaces clearly
   - Maintain composition over inheritance

4. **Utility Dependencies**
   - Create pure utility functions
   - Document interfaces clearly
   - Test thoroughly

## Next Steps

1. Categorize all imports in the Homepage feature
2. Create a dependency graph
3. Design proper interfaces for each dependency type
4. Implement incremental changes to reduce coupling
