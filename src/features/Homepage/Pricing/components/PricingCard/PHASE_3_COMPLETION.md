## 🔧 Implementation Details

### PricingCardHeader Architecture
```typescript
PricingCardHeader
├── Props: PricingCardHeaderProps
├── Logic Functions:
│   ├── getPlanNameGradient() - Plan-specific gradient selection
│   ├── getBadgeClasses() - Plan-specific badge styling
│   └── shouldShowHoverHint() - Hover hint visibility logic
└── Render Structure:
    ├── Popular badge (conditional, absolute positioned)
    └── Header container:
        ├── Plan badge with icons
        ├── Plan name with gradient
        ├── Description text
        └── Hover hint (conditional)
```

### PricingCardFeatures Architecture
```typescript
PricingCardFeatures
├── Props: PricingCardFeaturesProps
├── Logic Functions:
│   ├── visibleFeatures - Slice based on expansion state
│   └── remainingFeaturesCount - Calculate remaining features
└── Render Structure:
    ├── Header with expand/collapse button
    ├── Feature list (ul) with:
    │   ├── Feature items with Check icons
    │   ├── Individual tooltips
    │   ├── Highlighting classes
    │   └── Fade-in animations
    └── Remaining features count (conditional)
```

### Component Communication Patterns
- **Props down**: Parent passes plan data and state
- **Callbacks up**: Components call parent functions for interactions
- **State management**: Features expansion handled by parent component
- **Styling**: CSS classes preserved exactly from original

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 4

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Phase 4 can begin immediately** - Header and Features extraction successful
2. **CTA component extraction** - Ready for implementation
3. **Tooltip component extraction** - Dependencies clearly mapped
4. **Integration testing** - Components ready for main assembly

### Phase 4 Prerequisites ✅
- ✅ Header and Features components fully functional and tested
- ✅ Component interfaces established and working
- ✅ CSS class preservation strategy proven effective
- ✅ Type definitions established for CTA and Tooltip components

### Rollback Plan
- Original Pricing component remains unchanged
- Can switch back to inline header/features logic by reverting component usage
- All styling and behavior patterns preserved for compatibility

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- **Clean extraction** maintained exact visual and behavioral parity
- **TypeScript interfaces** prevented integration issues during extraction
- **Test-driven approach** caught edge cases and styling issues early
- **Component isolation** works perfectly with proper prop passing

### Optimizations for Phase 4
- CTA component will need careful hover state management
- Tooltip positioning logic needs to be preserved exactly
- Component composition patterns are now well established
- CSS class strategy is working effectively

## 🔄 Phase 4 Handoff

### Ready to Extract Next
1. **PricingCardCTA component** - Button with hover states and plan-specific styling
2. **PricingCardTooltip component** - Pro/Elite/Basic tooltips with positioning
3. **Hover state integration** - Coordinate between multiple components
4. **Plan interaction logic** - Click handlers and callback management

### Key Focus Areas for Phase 4
- Maintain CTA button gradients and hover effects
- Preserve tooltip positioning above CTA button
- Keep interactive state management intact
- Test all click and hover interactions thoroughly
