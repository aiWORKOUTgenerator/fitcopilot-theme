# Training Calendar Event Workflow Verification

This guide helps verify that the complete event creation and display workflow is working properly.

## 🎯 Workflow Overview

When a user creates an event and saves it, it should display with details on the calendar:

1. **User Creates Event** → EventModal form
2. **Event Gets Saved** → WordPress backend via AJAX
3. **Event Displays** → Appears on FullCalendar with details

## ✅ Verification Methods

### Method 1: Automated Test (Recommended)

1. **Load the test script:**
   ```html
   <script src="src/features/Homepage/TrainingCalendar/tests/event-workflow-test.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Open browser console and run:**
   ```javascript
   // Quick status check
   checkCalendarStatus()
   
   // Full workflow test
   testEventWorkflow()
   ```

3. **Expected Results:**
   ```
   🎉 Event Workflow Test Complete!
   ✅ Calendar component loaded
   ✅ Calendar data available
   ✅ Event creation successful
   ✅ Backend integration working
   ✅ Event visible in calendar
   🎯 Workflow Status: WORKING
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Testing

1. **Navigate to page with Training Calendar**
2. **Click "Create Event" or similar button**
3. **Fill out event form:**
   - Title: "Test Workout Session"
   - Date: Tomorrow
   - Time: Any available slot
   - Trainer: Select from dropdown
   - Location: "Google Meet"
4. **Click "Save Event"**
5. **Verify event appears on calendar**
6. **Click event to view details**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Event Not Saving
**Symptoms:** Form submits but no success message, or error appears
**Solutions:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify WordPress AJAX nonce is present
- Check user permissions
- Verify database tables exist

### Issue 2: Event Saves But Doesn't Display
**Symptoms:** Success message appears but event not visible on calendar
**Solutions:**
- Refresh the page
- Check auto-refresh is enabled
- Verify event date is within calendar view
- Check if event has proper styling (may be invisible)

### Issue 3: Event Displays But Missing Details
**Symptoms:** Event appears as blank or incomplete
**Solutions:**
- Check data transformation in `transformWordPressEvent()`
- Verify all required fields are being saved
- Check FullCalendar configuration
- Validate event object structure

## 🎨 Event Display Verification

### Visual Checks
- [ ] Event title displays correctly
- [ ] Event time shows proper duration
- [ ] Event has appropriate background color
- [ ] Event is clickable
- [ ] Event modal opens with full details

### Data Checks
- [ ] Event ID is present and valid
- [ ] Start/end dates are correct
- [ ] Trainer information is displayed
- [ ] Location shows (Google Meet, etc.)
- [ ] Booking status is accurate

## 📊 Component Architecture

### Frontend Components
```
TrainingCalendar.tsx
├── useCalendarData.ts (data management)
├── EventModal.tsx (create/edit forms)
├── CalendarView.tsx (FullCalendar display)
└── EventTypeSelector.tsx (smart scheduling)
```

### Backend Components
```
WordPress AJAX
├── save_individual_calendar_event (create/update)
├── delete_calendar_event (delete)
├── get_calendar_events (fetch)
└── Database: wp_content_fitcopilot_training_calendar
```

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- **Optimistic Updates**: Events appear immediately while saving
- **Fallback Safety**: Local storage if AJAX fails
- **Auto-refresh**: 30-second intervals for data consistency
- **Caching**: WordPress object cache for trainer data

### Monitoring
- Check console for performance warnings
- Monitor AJAX response times
- Verify memory usage doesn't grow over time

## 🔐 Security Validation

### AJAX Security
- [ ] Nonce validation working
- [ ] User permission checks active
- [ ] Data sanitization in place
- [ ] SQL injection prevention

### Data Validation
- [ ] Required fields enforced
- [ ] Date/time validation
- [ ] Trainer ID validation
- [ ] Input sanitization

## 📋 Test Scenarios

### Basic Workflow
1. Create event with all required fields ✅
2. Create event with minimal fields ✅
3. Edit existing event ✅
4. Delete event ✅

### Edge Cases
1. Create event with special characters in title
2. Create event with very long description
3. Create event with invalid trainer ID
4. Create event with past date
5. Create multiple events on same day/time

### Error Scenarios
1. Network failure during save
2. WordPress site down
3. Invalid nonce
4. Insufficient permissions

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The event workflow is considered **WORKING** when:

1. ✅ Events save successfully to WordPress database
2. ✅ Events display immediately on calendar (optimistic updates)
3. ✅ Events persist after page refresh
4. ✅ Event details are complete and accurate
5. ✅ Error handling works gracefully
6. ✅ Performance is acceptable (< 2 seconds for save operation)
