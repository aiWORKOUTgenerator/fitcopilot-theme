# Training Component Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimization strategies implemented in the Training component to ensure efficient rendering and interaction.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Data Separation

Large static default data has been moved to a dedicated file:

- `src/features/Homepage/Training/data/defaultPrograms.ts` - Contains all default program data, section title, and description
- Reduces the main component file size and allows for better code splitting

### 2. Component Memoization

All sub-components have been memoized using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders:

- **ProgramCard**: Memoized to prevent re-renders when parent state changes but props remain the same
- **BenefitsList**: Memoized to optimize rendering of program benefits
- **ExpandedContent**: New memoized component extracted from inline JSX to optimize expanded content rendering

### 3. Callback Memoization

Event handlers and callbacks have been optimized with useCallback:

- **handleToggleProgramDetails**: Memoized in the main Training component
- **handleNavigateToProgram**: Memoized in the main Training component
- **toggleProgramDetails**: Memoized in the useTrainingPrograms hook
- **navigateToProgram**: Memoized in the useTrainingPrograms hook
- **handleKeyDown**: Memoized in the ProgramCard component

### 4. Render Optimization

Conditional rendering was optimized:

- Extracted expanded content into a separate memoized component
- Only renders when a program is selected

### 4. Icon Handling

The Training component has been optimized for performance in icon handling:

- Icons are now dynamically created from a map of program types to Lucide components
- This avoids the need for large inline SVG strings in the data files
- Icons are only created when needed, reducing memory usage
- Using Lucide components ensures consistent styling and reduces bundle size

## Performance Testing

A performance test suite has been created at `src/features/Homepage/Training/tests/performance.test.tsx` to validate the optimizations:

- Tests for component render efficiency
- Verifies memoization is preventing unnecessary re-renders
- Measures render times for components with performance.now()
- Validates that interactive elements work correctly

## Results

These optimizations result in:

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Moving default data to a separate file enables better code splitting
2. **Fewer Re-renders**: Memoized components only re-render when their props change
3. **Improved Interaction Performance**: Memoized callbacks prevent recreation on each render
4. **Better User Experience**: More responsive UI, especially when interacting with program cards

## Recommended Next Steps

For further performance improvements, consider:

1. **Image Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for program icons or images
2. **Virtualization**: If the list of programs grows significantly, consider implementing virtualization
3. **Dynamic Imports**: Use dynamic imports to further split code by variant
4. **Web Vitals Monitoring**: Add monitoring for Core Web Vitals in production
