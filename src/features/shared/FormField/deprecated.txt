# Deprecated Files in FormField Component System

## [REMOVED] validation.ts
This file has been removed in Phase 5 of the FormField component system cleanup.
It has been replaced by validators.ts to break circular dependencies.

The functions in validation.ts have been migrated to validators.ts with proper TypeScript typing.
The runValidators function has been implemented directly in formState.ts to avoid circular dependencies.

Additional enhancements to the validation system in Phase 5:
1. Added async validation support with loading states
2. Implemented cross-field validation (fieldsMatch, fieldsDiffer)
3. Added conditional validators
4. Created validation composition (composeValidators)
5. Enhanced test coverage for all validation scenarios
6. Improved documentation in README.md
