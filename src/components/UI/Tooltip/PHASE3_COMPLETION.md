# Phase 3 - Consumer Component Migration

This phase focused on standardizing the tooltip usage across consumer components (Hero and Pricing) by implementing theme context providers and enhancing the variant-specific tooltip components.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Theme Context Provider Implementation

- Added `TooltipThemeProvider` components around Hero and Pricing sections
- Updated both components to use the provider pattern for theme inheritance
- Removed explicit `themeContext` props from individual tooltips, making them use the context

### 2. Pricing Variant Enhancement

- Created dedicated `pricing-theme-variables.scss` file with theme-specific styling
- Implemented plan-specific styling via the `planType` prop ("basic", "pro", "elite")
- Updated the variant's TypeScript interface to include `planType`
- Added data attributes for plan-based styling (`data-plan="pro"`, etc.)

### 3. Consumer Components Migration

- Updated the Hero component to use the theme provider
- Updated the Pricing component to use plan types instead of hardcoded accent colors
- Fixed all feature tooltips to use standardized props in Pricing

### 4. CSS Variable System Standardization

- Added appropriate CSS variables for consistent styling
- Ensured theme variables are applied consistently
- Enhanced SCSS variants with cleaner variable usage
- Improved SCSS organization by ensuring `@use` and `@import` follow correct order

## Enhanced Tooltip API

The tooltip API now supports:

```tsx
<TooltipThemeProvider theme="pricing">
  {/* All tooltips within get this theme by default */}
  <Tooltip
    content="Feature info"
    planType="pro" 
    position="top"
    title="Optional title"
    icon={<Icon />}
  >
    <span>Hover me</span>
  </Tooltip>
</TooltipThemeProvider>
```

The Pricing component can now consistently apply plan-specific styles:

```tsx
<Tooltip
  content="Pro-specific feature info"
  planType="pro" 
  {...otherProps}
>
  <span>Pro feature</span>
</Tooltip>
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Conversion of @import to @use** - Many SCSS files still use the deprecated `@import` rule
2. **Enhanced Theme System** - Could be extended to support more section-specific themes
3. **Animation Standardization** - Both Hero and Pricing still have custom animation properties

## Testing

All tooltips render correctly with appropriate styling in both sections. The build succeeds without errors and all dependencies are correctly resolved.
