# Phase 1 Completion: Component API Unification

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Unified Props Interface
- Created a comprehensive `TooltipProps` interface that merges existing implementations
- Added support for new props: `titleColor`, `width`, `isVisible`, `accentColor`, and `id`
- Standardized position types and theme context types

### 2. Core Component Refactoring
- Implemented dual-mode state management for both controlled and uncontrolled usage
- Added React.lazy loading for theme variants to optimize performance
- Created consistent props forwarding to all variants

### 3. CSS Variable System
- Implemented a shared CSS variable system for consistent styling
- Created theme-specific variables and overrides
- Added support for reduced motion preferences

### 4. Unit Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite for the Tooltip component
- Added tests for basic rendering, controlled/uncontrolled behavior, and accessibility
- Implemented tests for all props and positioning options

### 5. Documentation
- Created detailed README with usage examples
- Added migration guide for updating existing implementations
- Documented all props and features

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: The tooltip component now has a consistent API across all sections of the application.
2. **Flexibility**: Developers can use either controlled or uncontrolled mode based on their needs.
3. **Customization**: The component supports custom styling with props rather than direct CSS.
4. **Performance**: Theme variants are loaded on demand using React.lazy.
5. **Accessibility**: The component follows accessibility best practices.

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### 1. Hero Variant Update
- Update the Hero variant to support controlled visibility
- Apply consistent state management pattern
- Ensure proper handling of all props

### 2. Pricing Variant Implementation
- Complete the Pricing variant implementation
- Ensure theme-specific styling
- Test with pricing section use cases

### 3. CSS Variable Refinement
- Create component-specific CSS variable scopes
- Implement more granular theming options
- Optimize transitions and animations

### 4. Theme Context System
- Enhance theme context detection
- Add auto-detection of parent section
- Improve theme inheritance

### 5. Consumer Migration
- Update Hero section to use the standardized approach
- Refactor Pricing section to use the new variant system

## How to Use the New API
