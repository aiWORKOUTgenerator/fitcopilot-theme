# Media Component Testing Implementation Report

## Overview

This report documents the implementation of comprehensive test suites for media components in our React/TypeScript application, including what was accomplished and recommended next steps to address failing tests.

## Accomplishments

1. **Updated Test Patterns**
   - Converted to modern testing practices using `screen` queries
   - Implemented `userEvent` for more realistic user interactions
   - Added proper async handling with `waitFor` and `async/await`
   - Enhanced accessibility testing with role-based selectors

2. **Component Enhancements**
   - Added keyboard navigation to ImageGallery and MediaCarousel
   - Improved accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
   - Enhanced focus management for better user experience

3. **Testing Utilities**
   - Created `mediaEventUtils.ts` for simulating media events
   - Implemented `imageEventUtils.ts` for image-specific testing
   - Added `galleryTestUtils.ts` for testing carousel components
   - Developed comprehensive mock implementations for media APIs

4. **Documentation**
   - Produced detailed media testing guide
   - Created advanced examples document
   - Documented utility functions and testing patterns

## Current Test Status

Running the test suite revealed several failing tests that need to be addressed:

1. **Type errors in MediaCarousel tests**
   - Fixed by using const assertions (`'image' as const`)

2. **Multiple mounted components**
   - ImageMedia test has multiple elements with the same alt text
   - Need to use `cleanup` between test cases

3. **Component structure mismatches**
   - Fixed tests where selectors expected different class names
   - Updated selectors to match new component structure

4. **Accessibility role mismatches**
   - Need to update role expectations in AudioPlayer tests

5. **YouTube API mock issues**
   - Destroy method not being called

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix VideoPlayer Test Errors

The VideoPlayer tests show errors with DOM manipulation. Recommended fixes:

```typescript
// Update the VideoPlayer test setup
const setup = (props = {}) => {
  const defaultProps = {
    variant: 'video',
    src: 'test-video.mp4',
  };

  const mergedProps = { ...defaultProps, ...props };
  const user = userEvent.setup();
  
  // Create custom render with mediaEventUtils
  const utils = render(<VideoPlayer {...mergedProps} />);
  
  // Get video element and apply mock properties
  const videoElement = utils.container.querySelector('video');
  if (videoElement) {
    Object.defineProperty(videoElement, 'play', {
      value: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
    });
    Object.defineProperty(videoElement, 'pause', {
      value: jest.fn(),
    });
  }
  
  return {
    ...utils,
    user,
    videoElement,
  };
};
```

### 2. Fix AudioPlayer Role Issues

The AudioPlayer tests expect an element with role 'audio', but HTML5 audio elements don't have an implicit role:

```typescript
// Update test to look for audio element directly
it('renders with required props', () => {
  const { container } = render(
    <AudioPlayer variant="audio" src="audio.mp3" />
  );
  const audioElement = container.querySelector('audio');
  expect(audioElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 3. Fix ImageMedia Loading Tests

The ImageMedia test needs to clean up between test cases:

```typescript
it('handles loading and error states appropriately', async () => {
  const { container } = setup();
  
  const img = screen.getByAltText('Test image');
  
  // Test successful load
  await waitFor(() => {
    fireEvent.load(img);
  });
  
  expect(img).toBeInTheDocument();
  
  // Create a separate test for error state
});

it('handles error states appropriately', async () => {
  const { container } = setup();
  const img = screen.getByAltText('Test image');
  
  await waitFor(() => {
    fireEvent.error(img);
  });
  
  // Assert error handling
});
```

### 4. Fix Class Name Mismatches

Several tests expect different class names than what the components now use:

```typescript
// Update ImageGallery test
it('renders with required props', () => {
  const { container } = setup();
  
  // Updated selector to match new class name
  const galleryContainer = container.querySelector('.media-image-gallery');
  expect(galleryContainer).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 5. Fix YouTube API Mocking

The YouTube Player test needs a better mock:

```typescript
// In the test setup
beforeEach(() => {
  // Mock YouTube API global
  global.YT = {
    Player: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => mockYTPlayer),
  };
});

afterEach(() => {
  // Clean up
  delete global.YT;
  jest.clearAllMocks();
});
```

## Conclusion

The implementation of modern testing practices for media components has significantly improved the quality and maintainability of our test suite. Despite some failing tests, the groundwork is in place for a robust testing approach.

By addressing the specific issues outlined in this report, we can achieve a fully functioning test suite that ensures our media components operate correctly and maintain high accessibility standards.

The utility functions developed during this process will streamline future test development and maintenance, making it easier to add new tests as the application evolves.
