# **FitCopilot Homepage Pricing Component Sprint Plan**
## **Advanced Animation & Hover-to-Reveal Integration**

---

## **Executive Summary**

This sprint plan outlines the systematic replacement of the current Pricing component with the advanced version featuring sophisticated animations, hover-to-reveal beta pricing, particle effects, and enhanced accessibility. The implementation maintains architectural consistency with the established Homepage design system while introducing significant UX improvements.

---

## **Current Architecture Analysis**

### **Identified Inconsistencies & Gaps**

1. **Animation System**: Current implementation has basic price animations but lacks the sophisticated multi-state animation system
2. **Particle Effects**: Basic floating particles vs. advanced explosion/interaction particles  
3. **Hover States**: Limited hover interactions compared to the advanced hover-to-reveal system
4. **Performance**: Missing optimization patterns (useCallback, useMemo) present in advanced version
5. **Accessibility**: Current implementation has fewer ARIA attributes and reduced motion support
6. **Styling Architecture**: Current SCSS uses CSS variables but lacks the comprehensive animation classes

### **Strengths to Preserve**

1. **Design System Integration**: Proper use of design system variables and theme support
2. **Variant System**: Established theme variant architecture
3. **Component Structure**: Feature-first directory organization
4. **TypeScript Patterns**: Consistent type definitions and interfaces

## **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Animation System Architecture**

```typescript
// Animation timing constants
const ANIMATION_TIMINGS = {
  PRO_EXPLODE: 2000,
  PRO_TRANSITION: 3000,
  PRO_BETA: 3500,
  PRO_RESET: 8500,
  // ... more timings
} as const;

// State management
type AnimationState = 'normal' | 'exploding' | 'transitioning' | 'betaPrice';
```

### **Performance Optimizations**

```typescript
// Memoized particle rendering
const renderExplosionParticles = useMemo(() => {
  // Optimized particle generation
}, []);

// Optimized event handlers
const handleCardMouseEnter = useCallback((planName: string) => {
  // Efficient hover handling
}, [clearAllBasicTimeouts]);
```

### **SCSS Architecture**

```scss
// Design system integration
@use '../../../styles/design-system' as ds;

// GPU-accelerated animations
.pricing-card {
  will-change: transform, opacity;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  perspective: 1000px;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

// Responsive particle system
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .price-particles {
    display: none; // Performance optimization
  }
