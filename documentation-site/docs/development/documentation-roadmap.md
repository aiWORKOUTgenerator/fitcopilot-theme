# Documentation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned improvements and additions to the FitCopilot documentation system.

## Current Status

The documentation system currently includes:

- Architecture documentation
- Component documentation with Storybook
- API reference
- Quality metrics dashboard

## Short-Term Goals (1-3 Months)

### Component Documentation Improvements
- [ ] Complete documentation for all existing components
- [ ] Add visual examples for all component variations
- [ ] Improve type documentation with more detailed descriptions
- [ ] Create interactive playground for component testing

### Automation Enhancements
- [ ] Improve JSDoc comment extraction for automatic documentation generation
- [ ] Implement automated accessibility testing and reporting
- [ ] Set up automated visual regression testing with Chromatic
- [ ] Create automated bundle size monitoring

### Metrics Dashboard
- [ ] Implement real-time Core Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] Add code quality metrics (complexity, test coverage)
- [ ] Create trend visualization for all metrics
- [ ] Add PR-specific performance impact assessment

## Mid-Term Goals (3-6 Months)

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Create interactive tutorials for common development tasks
- [ ] Implement searchable documentation with algolia
- [ ] Create a developer FAQ section based on common questions
- [ ] Add a troubleshooting guide for common issues

### Feature Documentation
- [ ] Create user flow diagrams for each feature
- [ ] Document state management patterns with examples
- [ ] Add data flow documentation for API integrations
- [ ] Create architectural decision records (ADRs)

### Testing Documentation
- [ ] Document testing strategies and patterns
- [ ] Create example test cases for different component types
- [ ] Document end-to-end testing approach
- [ ] Implement test coverage visualization

## Long-Term Goals (6-12 Months)

### Documentation as Code
- [ ] Fully integrate documentation with code using literate programming
- [ ] Implement live code examples that sync with repository
- [ ] Create versioned documentation that matches code releases
- [ ] Develop a design system documentation linked to implementation

### Community Contributions
- [ ] Create contributor guidelines and templates
- [ ] Set up documentation contribution workflow
- [ ] Implement suggestion system for documentation improvements
- [ ] Create community showcase for implementations

### Advanced Metrics
- [ ] Implement user experience metrics tracking
- [ ] Create performance budgets and automated enforcement
- [ ] Set up competitor benchmarking for key metrics
- [ ] Develop predictive analytics for performance trends

## Implementation Approach

Each goal will be implemented following this process:

1. **Research**: Investigate best practices and tools
2. **Design**: Create a detailed implementation plan
3. **Implementation**: Develop the feature or improvement
4. **Testing**: Verify functionality and gather feedback
5. **Documentation**: Document the feature itself
6. **Release**: Make the improvement available to all developers

## Progress Tracking

Progress on this roadmap will be tracked in the following ways:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Each task will have a corresponding GitHub issue
2. **Project Board**: A project board will track the status of each task
3. **Release Notes**: Completed items will be documented in release notes
4. **Metrics**: Improvements will be measured using the metrics dashboard
