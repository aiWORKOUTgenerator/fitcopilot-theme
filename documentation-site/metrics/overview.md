# Quality Metrics Overview

## Introduction

FitCopilot maintains high standards for code quality, performance, and user experience. This metrics dashboard provides insights into various aspects of quality across the codebase and application.

## Metrics Categories

The metrics are organized into three main categories:

### Performance Metrics

Metrics related to application performance, including:

- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Lighthouse scores
- Bundle size analysis
- Load time measurements

[View Performance Metrics →](./performance/overview.md)

### Code Quality Metrics

Metrics related to code quality and reliability, including:

- Test coverage
- Type safety
- Code complexity
- ESLint rule compliance

[View Code Quality Metrics →](./code-quality/overview.md)

### Visual Regression

Metrics and tools for tracking visual consistency, including:

- Visual regression test results
- Chromatic snapshot reviews
- UI consistency checks

## Automated Metrics Collection

All metrics are collected automatically through our CI/CD pipeline:

1. **On Pull Request**: Metrics are calculated and compared to baseline
2. **On Merge to Main**: Metrics are recorded as the new baseline
3. **Weekly Report**: Aggregated metrics are reported weekly

## Performance Targets

FitCopilot aims to meet or exceed the following performance targets:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Lighthouse Performance | ≥ 90 |
| Lighthouse Accessibility | ≥ 95 |
| Lighthouse Best Practices | ≥ 95 |
| Lighthouse SEO | ≥ 95 |
| Test Coverage | ≥ 80% |
| TypeScript Strict Compliance | 100% |
| Bundle Size (main.js) | ≤ 200kb |
| First Contentful Paint | ≤ 1.8s |
| Largest Contentful Paint | ≤ 2.5s |
| Cumulative Layout Shift | ≤ 0.1 |

## Historical Trends

Performance and quality metrics are tracked over time to identify trends and improvements. The historical data is available for:

- Last 30 days
- Last 90 days
- Last 365 days

## How We Use Metrics

These metrics guide our development process in several ways:

1. **Pull Request Reviews**: PR reviews include automated quality checks
2. **Refactoring Priorities**: Metrics help identify areas for improvement
3. **Performance Optimization**: Performance bottlenecks are highlighted for attention
4. **Release Go/No-Go**: Release decisions consider quality metrics

## Tools and Integrations

The metrics dashboard is powered by:

- **Lighthouse CI**: For performance and accessibility metrics
- **CodeCov**: For test coverage reporting
- **SonarCloud**: For code quality analysis
- **Chromatic**: For visual regression testing
