## Task Assignments

Each developer should create a branch from `token-compliance/boilerplate` following the naming convention `token-compliance/[component-name]`.

| Developer  | Primary Component                | Secondary Component    | Branch Name                      | Props (approx) | Status       |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Developer 1| PersonalTraining                 | Footer                 | token-compliance/personal-training| 125            | In Progress  |
| Developer 2| Training & TrainingFeatures      | -                      | token-compliance/training        | 117            | Not Started  |
| Developer 3| Features                         | FeatureCard            | token-compliance/features        | 99             | Not Started  |
| Developer 4| Pricing                          | PricingCard            | token-compliance/pricing         | 60             | Complete âœ…   |
| Developer 5| UI Components                    | -                      | token-compliance/ui              | 87             | Not Started  |
| Developer 6| Journey                          | JourneyStep            | token-compliance/journey         | 27             | Complete âœ…   |
| Developer 7| Testimonials                     | TestimonialCard        | token-compliance/testimonials    | 16             | Not Started  |
| Developer 8| DemoNav                          | design-system          | token-compliance/demo-nav        | 29             | Not Started  |

## Component Dependencies

Note any component dependencies to coordinate work effectively:

- FeatureCard depends on the UI Card component
- TestimonialCard depends on the UI Card component
- Consider UI components first as others may depend on them

## Component Complexity Assessment

Complexity factors to consider:
- Number of properties (shown above)
- Number of variants/states
- Animation complexity
- Responsive behavior

### Higher Complexity
- PersonalTraining (123 properties, complex animations)
- Training/TrainingFeatures (117 combined properties)
- UI Components (shared, many dependencies)

### Medium Complexity
- Features (86 properties)
- Pricing (47 properties) âœ… Completed

### Lower Complexity
- Journey/JourneyStep (27 combined properties) âœ… Completed
- Testimonials/TestimonialCard (16 combined properties)
- DemoNav (3 properties)
- Footer/FooterLinkGroup (3 combined properties)

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date | Components |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Phase 1   | [DATE]      | Hero (Complete), UI Components, DemoNav |
| Phase 2   | [DATE]      | Training, Journey (Complete), Footer |
| Phase 3   | [DATE]      | PersonalTraining, Features |
| Phase 4   | [DATE]      | Pricing (Complete), Testimonials |
| Final     | [DATE]      | 100% token compliance across all components |

## Progress Summary

Components completed:
1. Hero - 100% tokenized
2. Journey - 100% tokenized (April 27, 2025)
3. Pricing - 100% tokenized (April 27, 2025)

Next targets:
1. Testimonials - Planned for Phase 4
2. Features - Planned for Phase 3

## Tracking Progress

We'll track progress with:

1. Weekly compliance script runs in the main repo
2. A compliance dashboard (updated daily)
3. PR reviews ensuring 100% component compliance before merge

## Definition of Done

A component is considered fully tokenized when:

1. The token compliance script shows 100% compliance
2. Visual regression tests pass
3. Code review has been completed
4. The PR has been merged into develop

## Kickoff Meeting

We'll have a kickoff meeting on [DATE] to:
- Review the token compliance guide
- Demo the Hero component implementation
- Answer questions
- Assign tasks
