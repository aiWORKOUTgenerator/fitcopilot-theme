# Test Remediation Phase 1: Analysis and Documentation

## Overview

This PR completes Phase 1 of the test remediation project, which focused on analyzing the structural changes in the codebase and documenting patterns to guide test fixes in Phase 2.

## Key Deliverables

- **Documentation**:
  - Type Guard Migration Map
  - Component Structure Analysis
  - Test Migration Guide
  - Phase 1 Analysis Summary
  - Project README and Index

- **Tools**:
  - Type Guard Import Updater Script

## Approach

The analysis focused on identifying patterns in the component changes that are causing test failures. Key findings include:

1. Type guards were systematically moved from component-specific files to centralized utility files
2. Discriminator properties use two different conventions (`type` vs `variant`)
3. Component structures have evolved with enhanced type safety and BEM-style CSS

## Testing

The import updater script has been tested in dry-run mode on representative components:
- Media component tests
- Button component tests 

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

The next phase will focus on implementing fixes based on the analysis:
1. Fix critical module issues
2. Create automated test updating tools
3. Address component-specific test issues
4. Implement bypasses for CI where necessary

## Documentation

- [Phase 1 Analysis Summary](./docs/phase1-analysis-summary.md)
- [Type Guard Migration Map](./docs/type-guard-migration-map.md)
- [Component Structure Analysis](./docs/component-structure-analysis.md)
- [Test Migration Guide](./docs/test-migration-guide.md)
- [Project README](./docs/README.md)

## How to Use the Documentation

To review the findings and prepare for Phase 2:
1. Start with the Phase 1 Analysis Summary for a high-level overview
2. Refer to the Type Guard Migration Map for specific import path changes
3. Use the Component Structure Analysis to understand component evolution
4. Follow the Test Migration Guide for step-by-step instructions
