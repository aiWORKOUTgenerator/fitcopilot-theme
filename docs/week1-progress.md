# Week 1 Sprint Progress Report

## Overview

During Week 1 of the ESLint remediation sprint, we've successfully implemented the foundational patterns and utilities needed to systematically address ESLint warnings across the codebase. Our focus was on establishing strong type patterns for Button and Form components, creating utility functions for event handling and logging, and setting up automation scripts for ongoing remediation.

## Accomplishments

### Type Safety Patterns
- ✅ Created discriminated union pattern for Button component
- ✅ Implemented type guards for Button variants
- ✅ Created form field type system with discriminated unions
- ✅ Implemented type guards for form field variants
- ✅ Documented patterns for future component implementations

### Utilities
- ✅ Implemented structured logger utility
- ✅ Created typed event handler utilities
- ✅ Added support for logged event handlers with context

### Automation Scripts
- ✅ Created script to analyze warning patterns
- ✅ Implemented script to prefix unused variables
- ✅ Implemented script to replace console statements with logger
- ✅ Created progress report generation script

### Component Implementations
- ✅ Refactored Button component to use type system
- ✅ Implemented TextField component with type system
- ✅ Added tests for Button component type guards

## Type System Changes

### Before
```typescript
// Using 'any' in component props
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: string;
  onClick?: any;
  href?: string;
  children: any;
}
```

### After
```typescript
// Using discriminated union pattern
interface BaseButtonProps {
  variant?: VariantKey;
  size?: ButtonSize;
  disabled?: boolean;
  className?: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

interface ActionButtonProps extends BaseButtonProps {
  onClick: ButtonClickHandler;
  type?: 'button' | 'submit' | 'reset';
  href?: never; // Discriminator property
}

interface LinkButtonProps extends BaseButtonProps {
  href: string;
  target?: '_blank' | '_self' | '_parent' | '_top';
  rel?: string;
  onClick?: never; // Discriminator property
  type?: never; // Discriminator property
}

type ButtonProps = ActionButtonProps | LinkButtonProps;
```

## Documentation

- ✅ Created eslint-pattern-implementation.md with detailed patterns
- ✅ Added before/after examples for each pattern
- ✅ Documented type guard testing approach
- ✅ Created reusable patterns for other component families

## Next Steps

For Week 2, we'll focus on:

1. **Component Expansion**
   - Apply patterns to Media components
   - Implement Card component type system
   - Convert additional form components (Select, Checkbox)

2. **Hook Optimization**
   - Analyze and fix useEffect dependency issues
   - Create custom hook type patterns
   - Implement proper memoization strategies

3. **Progress Measurement**
   - Generate updated warning report
   - Track progress against baseline
   - Identify next highest-impact components

The foundations established in Week 1 will allow us to accelerate remediation in Week 2, with an expected 70-75% reduction in ESLint warnings by the end of Week 2.
