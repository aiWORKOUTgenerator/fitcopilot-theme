# ESLint Warning Reduction Progress

## Summary

- **Baseline Warnings**: 42
- **Current Warnings**: 56
- **Reduction**: -33% (-14 warnings fixed)

## Warnings by Rule

| Rule | Count |
|------|-------|
| @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any | 25 |
| @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars | 21 |
| fitcopilot/use-logger | 8 |
| react-hooks/exhaustive-deps | 2 |

## Most Affected Files

| File | Warning Count |
|------|--------------|
| src/utils/logger/index.ts | 8 |
| src/utils/events/index.ts | 6 |
| src/features/shared/examples/FormExample.tsx | 4 |
| src/features/Homepage/Homepage.stories.tsx | 2 |
| src/features/Homepage/Journey/Journey.tsx | 2 |
| src/features/Homepage/PersonalTraining/PersonalTraining.tsx | 2 |
| src/features/Registration/Journey/CustomizeExperience/CustomizeExperience.tsx | 2 |
| src/features/Registration/utils/scrollUtils.ts | 2 |
| src/hooks/useWordPress.ts | 2 |
| src/utils/__tests__/debugTypeGuards.test.ts | 2 |

## Next Steps

1. Focus on fixing `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` warnings, which have the highest count
2. Address issues in the most affected file: `src/utils/logger/index.ts`
3. Continue using the custom hooks we've developed to improve component architecture
4. Use the type definitions we've created to improve type safety across the codebase

## Recommendations

We should continue working to reach our goal of 80% warning reduction. Currently at -33%.

Further improvements can be made to eliminate all remaining warnings.

## Conclusion

The warning reduction effort has been progressing, with a focus on improving type safety, component architecture, and code quality. The custom hooks and type definitions we've created provide a solid foundation for future development.
