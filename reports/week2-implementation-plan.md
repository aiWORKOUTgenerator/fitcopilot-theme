# Week 2: Warning Reduction Implementation Plan

## Focus Areas

Based on our Week 1 analysis, we will focus on these key areas:

1. **Type Safety Improvements** - 22 high-priority warnings
2. **React Hook Dependency Fixes** - Medium priority
3. **Unused Variable Resolution** - High frequency pattern
4. **Component-Specific Fixes** - Targeting the most problematic components identified

## Daily Implementation Plan

### Monday: Type System Enhancement

- Create shared type definitions for common patterns
- Implement proper interfaces for API responses
- Replace explicit `any` types in UI components

### Tuesday: React Hook Optimizations

- Fix exhaustive dependencies in useEffect hooks
- Create custom hooks for common patterns
- Implement proper cleanup functions

### Wednesday: Unused Variable Resolution

- Add underscore prefix to intentionally unused parameters
- Remove truly unused variables
- Create utility functions for repeated patterns

### Thursday: Component-Specific Fixes

- Address warnings in high-priority components
- Implement fixes for feature-specific issues
- Update PropTypes with proper TypeScript interfaces

### Friday: Verification & Progress Assessment

- Run comprehensive ESLint check
- Compare warning counts against baseline
- Document patterns and solutions for team reference

## Expected Outcomes

- 50% reduction in overall warning count
- 80% reduction in high-priority warnings
- Improved type safety across all components
- Standardized patterns for React hooks and event handlers
