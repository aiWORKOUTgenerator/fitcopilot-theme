# Bootstrap Stability Improvements

This branch introduces several measures to prevent React bootstrap issues:

## Key Components

1. **Documentation**
   - Updated CRITICAL_PATTERNS.md with explicit warnings about webpack entry points
   - Enhanced documentation on React bootstrap patterns

2. **Verification Scripts**
   - Added verify-bootstrap.sh to validate bootstrap code in build output
   - Added e2e-mount-check.js for browser-based mount verification
   - Enhanced verify-mount-point.sh for more comprehensive checks

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Added GitHub Actions workflow for bootstrap verification
   - Integrated bootstrap checks in existing workflows

4. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Added Husky pre-commit hook to enforce bootstrap integrity

5. **Process Improvements**
   - Updated PR template with bootstrap verification checklist
   - Added post-build verification steps

## Motivation

These changes help prevent the "blank page" issue caused by incorrect webpack entry points
or missing bootstrap code, ensuring that React consistently mounts to the correct DOM element.
