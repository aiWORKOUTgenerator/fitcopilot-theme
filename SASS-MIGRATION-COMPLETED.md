# Sass Modernization - Completed

## Overview

This document outlines the Sass modernization that was completed to address the deprecated `@import` directives and ensure consistent usage of the design system across the FitCopilot theme.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Replaced Deprecated `@import` with Modern `@use` Directives**
   - All SCSS files now use the modern `@use` directive instead of the deprecated `@import`
   - Added proper namespacing (e.g., `@use '../../../styles/design-system' as ds;`)
   - Ensured all files include the canonical design system import

2. **Added Clear Canonical Import Comment**
   - All SCSS files include a comment indicating the canonical import: 
     `// Canonical design system import - MUST BE FIRST`

3. **Improved Build Verification**
   - Enhanced the SCSS verification script to check for:
     - Missing canonical design system imports
     - Deprecated `@import` directives (excluding CSS imports)
   - Updated the npm script to use the improved verification script

4. **Added Migration Scripts**
   - `migrate:scss`: Automatically converts `@import` for design system to `@use`
   - `migrate:scss:add-imports`: Adds canonical design system imports to files missing them
   - `migrate:scss:convert-imports`: Converts remaining `@import` directives to `@use`

## Benefits

1. **Future-Proofing**: Eliminated usage of deprecated Sass features
2. **Improved Performance**: `@use` is more efficient as it only includes files once
3. **Better Maintainability**: Proper namespacing prevents global variable collisions
4. **Consistent Architecture**: All components now follow the same import pattern

## Maintaining the Codebase

### Adding New SCSS Files

When creating new SCSS files, follow these guidelines:

1. Always include the canonical design system import at the top:
   ```scss
   // Canonical design system import - MUST BE FIRST
   @use '../../../styles/design-system' as ds;
   ```

2. Use the design system tokens via the namespace:
   ```scss
   .my-component {
     color: ds.$color-primary;
     margin: ds.$spacing-md;
     border-radius: ds.$border-radius-md;
   }
   ```

3. Import other SCSS files with `@use` and appropriate namespacing:
   ```scss
   @use './component-variables' as vars;
   ```

4. External CSS files may still use `@import`:
   ```scss
   @import 'external-library.css';
   ```

### Verifying SCSS Compliance

Before committing changes, run the verification script:

```bash
npm run verify:scss
```

This script will check that:
- All SCSS files include the canonical design system import
- No deprecated `@import` directives are used

### Automatic Migration

If you have multiple files that need to be updated:

1. To convert design system imports:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:scss [directory]
   ```

2. To add canonical imports to files missing them:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:scss:add-imports
   ```

3. To convert remaining @import directives:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:scss:convert-imports
   ```

## Conclusion

The Sass codebase has been successfully modernized, eliminating all deprecated features and establishing a consistent import pattern across all components. This update ensures better maintainability, improved performance, and compatibility with future Sass versions.
